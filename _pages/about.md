<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I will work as a research assistant professor at Clemson University since August. My research interests includes artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and computer vision with a focus on motion planning and reinforcement learning for physically-based character control and agent navigation.
I am also interested in applying computer science techniques to other disciplines, like bioengineering and environmental science.

I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Clemson University under the supervision of Prof. Ioannis Karamouzas. Prior to that, I received an MS from University of Minnesota at Twin Cities in electrical engineering.
